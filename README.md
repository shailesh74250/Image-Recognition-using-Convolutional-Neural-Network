# Image-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images

Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else  by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.  

For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have
